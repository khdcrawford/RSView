## Component Specification

## Software Components

The package `RSView` analyzes RSV G gene sequences in conjunction with information on the burden of disease (as extrapolated from childhood death rates due to acute respiratory tract infection) in order to better understand global RSV circulation dynamics and the role of RSV subtype on disease severity. In order to carry out the analysis, this package must be able to:
    
    1. Download RSV G gene sequences and appropriate metadata
    2. Tabulate this data and organize by genotype, collection date, and country
    3. Plot this RSV genotype data by location and year (on an interactive map)
    4. Compare RSV genotype data with disease severity metrics.
